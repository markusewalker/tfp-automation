# TFP-Automation Provisioning Sanity

In the tfp-automation provisioning sanity test, the following workflow is followed:

1. Setup Rancher HA utilizing Terraform resources + specified provider infrastructure
2. Provision downstream RKE1 / RKE2 / K3S clusters.
3. Perform post-cluster provisioning checks
4. Cleanup resources (Terraform explicitly needs to call its cleanup method so that each test doesn't experience caching issues)

Please see below for more details for your config. Please note that the config can be in either JSON or YAML (all examples are illustrated in YAML).

## Table of Contents
1. [Getting Started](#Getting-Started)
2. [Local Qase Reporting](#Local-Qase-Reporting)

## Getting Started
The config is split up into multiple parts. Think of the parts as follows:
- Standalone config for setting up Rancher
- Node driver config for provisioning downstream clusters
- Rancher config

In no particular order, see an example below:

# TERRATEST CONFIG

terratest:  
  etcdCount: 3
  controlPlaneCount: 2
  workerCount: 3
  windowsNodeCount: 1
  pathToRepo: "go/src/github.com/rancher/tfp-automation"
```

Before running, be sure to run the following commands:

```yaml
export RANCHER2_PROVIDER_VERSION=""
export CATTLE_TEST_CONFIG=<path/to/yaml>
export LOCALS_PROVIDER_VERSION=""
export CLOUD_PROVIDER_VERSION=""
export LETS_ENCRYPT_EMAIL=""                      # OPTIONAL - must provide a valid email address
```

See the below examples on how to run the tests:

`gotestsum --format standard-verbose --packages=github.com/rancher/tfp-automation/tests/sanity --junitfile results.xml --jsonfile results.json -- -timeout=2h -v -run "TestTfpSanityProvisioningTestSuite$"` \
`gotestsum --format standard-verbose --packages=github.com/rancher/tfp-automation/tests/sanity --junitfile results.xml --jsonfile results.json -- -timeout=2h -v -run "TestTfpSanityUpgradeRancherTestSuite$"`

If the specified test passes immediately without warning, try adding the -count=1 flag to get around this issue. This will avoid previous results from interfering with the new test run.

## Local Qase Reporting
If you are planning to report to Qase locally, then you will need to have the following done:
1. The `terratest` block in your config file must have `localQaseReporting: true`.
2. The working shell session must have the following two environmental variables set:
     - `QASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN=""`
     - `QASE_TEST_RUN_ID=""`
3. Append `./reporter` to the end of the `gotestsum` command. See an example below::
     - `gotestsum --format standard-verbose --packages=github.com/rancher/tfp-automation/tests/sanity  --junitfile results.xml --jsonfile results.json -- -timeout=2h -v -run "TestTfpSanityProvisioningTestSuite$";/path/to/tfp-automation/reporter`
